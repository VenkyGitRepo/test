    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Essential: downloads your code onto the runner

      # --- Optional: Add steps for linting/validation if you have them ---
      # If you have CSS or JavaScript files, you might want to lint them.
      # This requires installing relevant linters (e.g., stylelint for CSS, eslint for JS)
      # and configuring them.

      # Example: Setting up Node.js for a JS linter (even if it's not a Node.js 'project')
      # - name: Set up Node.js for Linting (if you have JS/CSS)
      #   uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      #   with:
      #     node-version: '18' # A recent LTS version is usually fine for linting tools

      # Example: Install a linter for HTML (e.g., HTMLHint)
      # You'd need to add 'htmlhint' to a package.json in your project, or install it globally on the runner.
      # For simplicity, if you're just starting, you might skip complex linting for now.
      # - name: Install HTML Linter
      #   run: npm install -g htmlhint # Or add to package.json and run 'npm ci'

      # - name: Run HTML Lint
      #   run: htmlhint . # Assumes HTMLHint is installed and configured

      # --- Basic Validation (Always useful) ---
      - name: Check for file presence (Basic sanity check)
        run: |
          ls -l
          if [ ! -f index.html ]; then # Adjust filename if it's not index.html
            echo "Error: index.html not found in the repository root."
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "index.html found. Basic file check passed."

      # You typically don't have "tests" in the same way a dynamic application does
      # for a purely static HTML file unless you're using a testing framework
      # like Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end tests, which is a more advanced topic.
